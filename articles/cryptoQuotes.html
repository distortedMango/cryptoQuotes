<p>This high-level API-client gives access to cryptocurrency market
data, without having to rely on low-level coding using
<code>httr2</code> or <code>curl</code>. All currently listed and
actively traded on most of the major cryptocurrencies are available for
download.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The library uses xts and zoo under the hood
and therefore follows the syntax of base R, and related libraries.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this vignette we will explore a case study to showcase the
capabilities of the library; how was the price action of Dogecoin
affected in the minutes after Elon Musk tweeted,</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

</h2>
<p>Elon Musk tweeted (Well, now he X’ed) about Dogecoin January 14,
06.18 AM (UTC) - and Dogecoin rallied. To determine how fast the markets
reacted to his tweets, we could get the market data for Dogecoin in 1
minute intervals the day he tweeeted using the
<code>getQuotes()</code>,</p>

<span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This returns an object of class xts and zoo with <code>500</code>
rows. To get a closer look on the price action around the tweet hour, we
can <code>subset</code> the data using the
<code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/window.html" class="external-link">window()</a></code>-function,</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This leaves 61 rows, corresponding to a minute by minute price
action. We can calculate the price rallying using the 19th row,
corresponding to the minute of the tweet. Dogecoin closed at 0.2055,
rallying 8.5%.</p>
